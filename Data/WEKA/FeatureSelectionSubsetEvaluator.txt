Attribute Subset Evaluator (supervised, Class (numeric): 102 Microsleep):
	CFS Subset Evaluator
	Including locally predictive attributes
	
	Evaluates the worth of a subset of attributes by considering the individual predictive ability of each feature along with the degree 
	of redundancy between them. Subsets of features that are highly correlated with the class while having low intercorrelation are preferred.
